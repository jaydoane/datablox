In order to run datablox, ZeroMQ must be installed in the system.

datablox depends on the following python modules:
    zmq python bindings

Individual blox depend on several others:
    pymongo 2.0.1 for Mongodb (also requires Mongodb to be running)
    sunburnt 0.5 for Solr (sunburnt in turn requires httplib2 and lxml)
See blox_meta folder for more information about individual blox.
